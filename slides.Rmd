# Motivation

### Why is market power bad?
--
count: false
- Econ 101: Deadweight loss b/c dominant firms withhold production. 

--
count: false

### But is this really true?
--
count: false
- Suprisingly difficult to verify empirically. 
- Identification is tough. Requires lots of imposed structure...
  
???
- Identification is hard (especially in a dynamic setting). 
- Firms don't merge with other firms by accident, or enter and exit markets at random. 
- They do so b/c of expectations about future profits, demand, etc.

--
count: false
### This paper 
- Identify causal impact of market power on firm behaviour (in reduced-form setting).
- Bridge the gap between theory and empirics. 

---

# Approach and contribution

### Exogenous formation of localized electricity markets
- Source: Transmission constraints.
- The *definition* of the market is changing over time.

### Plant-level data
- 500 Norwegian hydropower plants.
- Hydropower offers specific empirical advantages (more on this later).

### Research questions
  1. Do firms withold production when they gain more market power? 
  2. Welfare effects in this market?
  3. Are there environmental consequences?

# Hydropower is empirically unique

### Homogenous end-good (electricity)
- Don't have to worry about branding, advertising, etc.

### Dispatchable production
- Don't have to worry about production inertia.

### Negligible marginal costs
- Production based on the opportunity cost of water (use today vs. save tomorrow).


???
- Can abstract from many of the usual concerns in empirical I/O: MC estimation, product differentiation, branding...
- Inflows are seasonal (stochastic), but storable.
- Dynamic optimisation problem.
- Dominant firms increase profits by witholding production during periods with inelastic demand.

### This study

- Advantageous research design, combined with plant-level data. Richer variation in market power over longer period of time. (He said modestly.)

???
- General finding of previous literature is one of healthy competition, but with some scope for exercising local market power.
- Don't need to impose any structure on the data or models, nor do I require simulation and MC estimation.
- I find direct evidence of strategic, intertemporal firm behaviour over longer periods of time.

# Hydropower production

### Competition
- Equalise prices across periods (*a la* Hotelling).

### Market power
- Shift resources across periods (e.g. [monopolist case](#monopolist)).
- Undersupply in more inelastic demand periods. Oversupply in more elastic ones.

### Testable implication
- Dominant firms should maintain fuller reservoirs in inelastic demand periods. 

???
- Production in a hydro system is a dynamic optimisation problem.
  - How much to use today vs save for tomorrow?
  - Producer's decision is driven by the opportunity cost of water.
- Hotelling arbitrage argument: Prices equalised across periods by producing $\propto$ demand.
- Although, discounting not really appropriate for hydropower production horizon.
- General result is robust to various extensions (trade, uncertainty, etc.)
- P's and Q's diverge from their social optimums.
- Implies an observable difference in reservoir management.

name: sector

# Norwegian electricity sector

### Supply
- Hydropower totally dominant (> 95% of total).

### Demand
- Winter double that of summer... but heating is substitutable and market fosters consumer responsiveness (variable contracts, [in-house meters](#in-house), etc.)

### (Spoilers)
- Summer demand is significantly more *inelastic* than winter demand.
- Implies: Dominant firms to keep fuller reservoirs during summer (as they withhold production) and vice versa during winter.

???
- Similar seasonal elasticity in other high-latitude countries, e.g. Canada (<span style="color:#0c5999">Genc, 2016</span>).
- Approx. 85–90% of end-user contracts are either spot price contracts or (highly-correlated) variable
price contracts that may be terminated at short notice.

# Nord Pool and Elspot

### The market exchange 
- Norway is part of *Nord Pool*. 
  - The world's first (and still largest) multi-national power exchange.
- Foundation of Nord Pool is the day-ahead *Elspot* market.
- Elspot market comprises distinct bidding areas.

### Role of transmission constraints
- Not binding: Common system price in all areas.
- Binding: Areas become their own markets.
- Creates opportunities for exploiting local market power.

# Identification

### Two layers of exogenous variation
  
### 1. Transmission constraints 
- The ultimate mechanism for changes in market power.
- *Why* do firms gain/lose local market power?
- Exogeneity: Physical nature of electricity, geography.
- <a href="http://driftsdata.statnett.no/Web/Map/snpscustom?language=en" target="_blank">Link</a>. [Stills](#prices-flows-stills).

### 2. Bidding area (re)configuration
- Adds richness by affecting the [magnitude](#variation) of change.
- *How much* market power do firms get?
- Exogeneity: Maintenance, new regions, climate, geography.
- <a href="http://www.statnett.no/en/Market-and-operations/the-power-market/" target="_blank">Link</a>. [Stills](#config-stills).

Together, these layers allow me to trace out the response of individual plants at *varying* levels of market power.

???
- Following other studies (<span style="color:#0c5999">Joskow and Tirole, 2000</span>; <span style="color:#0c5999">Borenstein et al., 2000</span>; <span style="color:#0c5999">Steen, 2004</span>; <span style="color:#0c5999">Mirza and Bergland, 2012</span>), I focus on *local* market power that arises from transmission constraints between bidding areas.
- However, my dataset allows me to go further by exploiting the exogenous changes in bidding areas that occur over time.
    + Reservoirs are reassigned to a new bidding areas where the owner firms have more (or less) market power.
- Control for potential problems that arise from changing demand by using zone and regime fixed effects.

# Data

### Hydropower reservoirs (2000-2013)
- Daily time series data for the 500 largest reservoirs in Norway (2 million obs).
- Approximately 90% of the total system capacity.
- Matched to other important covariates, such as plant ID, producer info, GIS, etc.

### Electricity flows and prices (2000-2013)
- Prices and flows per bidding area over the same period.
- Transmission constraints and boundary changes. 

### Electricity bid curves (2014-2017)
- Allows for direct measurement of demand elasticities.

### Weather (2000-2013)
- Precipitation and temperature data as controls.

# Residual Supply Index

### A better measure of market power 

(And new to this version of the paper)

$$ RSI_f = \frac{\text{Total capacity} - \text{Firm f's capacity}}{\text{Total Demand}} $$

Basically, how difficult is it to meet supply without firm f's production?

--

</br>

Note that $\downarrow$ RSI $\Rightarrow \,\uparrow$ market power

- RSI < 1 implies that a firm is "pivotal".

# Conclusions

### Approach

- Exploit exogenous variation in localized electricity markets (source: transmission constraints).
- Pair with a rich dataset of Norwegian hydropower firms and electricity flows.

### Results
- Empirical results closely match the predictions of theory.
- 1% $\uparrow$ in local market share leads to $\pm$ 0.3% $\uparrow$ in reservoir volumes.
   - Opposite effect in winter.
- Numerous reasons to view these results as a lower bound.

### Policy relevance
- Even "competitive" markets are susceptible to manipulation and welfare losses.
- Hydro producers may not fully accommodate intermittent renewables like wind. Though, could also ameliorate impacts of market power. (Follow-up study.)

???
- Focus on hydropower brings its own unique empirical advantages.
- Caveats
    + Assume that firm ownership stays constant over time
    + Don't consider effects of partial- and cross-ownership.
    + Still need to calculate price effects (waiting on data).

# Monopolist's problem

Consider the simplest theoretical case: Hydropower monopoly in two-period model (summer and winter).
- No uncertainty, reservoir limits or trade

Monopolist maximizes revenue subject to her water endowment.

$$\max \sum^2_{t=1} p_t \left( q_t \right) \cdot q_t$$
s.t. 
$$\sum^2_{t=1}{q_t} \leq, W$$

- $p_t \left( q_t \right)$ is an inverse demand function,
- $q_t$ is the (water-equivalent) electricity demand,
- $W$ is the known water endowment for the monopolist's reservoir.

# Monopoly (cont.)

$$\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_t} = {p_{t}} ' \left( q_t \right) \cdot q_t + p_t \left( q_t \right) - \lambda &\leq 0 \\ (	& = 0 \text{ for } q_t > 0 ) \end{aligned}$$

and

$$\begin{aligned} \lambda & \geq 0 \\ (	& = 0 \text{ for } \sum^2_{t=1} q_t < W ) \end{aligned}$$
Rearranging gives:

$$
p_1 \left( q_1 \right) \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\epsilon_1} \right) = p_2 \left( q_2 \right) \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\epsilon_2} \right) = \lambda,
$$

where $\epsilon_t = \frac{p_t}{q_t}\frac{\partial q_t}{\partial p_t} < 0$ is the price elasticity of demand.

# Monopoly (cont.)

Summary: Prices and quantities depend on the relative demand elasticities in each period. E.g:

$$
	p_1 \left( q_1 \right) > p_2 \left( q_2\right) \text{ }\text{ }\text{ if }\text{ }\text{ } \left| \epsilon_1 \left( q_1 \right) \right| < \left| \epsilon_2 \left( q_2 \right) \right| .
$$
and
$$
	q_1 < q_2 \text{ }\text{ }\text{ if }\text{ }\text{ } \left| \epsilon_1 \left( q_1 \right) \right| < \left| \epsilon_2 \left( q_2 \right) \right| .
$$
